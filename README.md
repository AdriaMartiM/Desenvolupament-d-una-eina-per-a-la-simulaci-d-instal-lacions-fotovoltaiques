# Desenvolupament-d-una-eina-per-a-la-simulaci-d-instal-lacions-fotovoltaiques
This work presents the development of a program aimed at optimizing photovoltaic systems in urban environments. The main objective is to design a tool capable of generating detailed profiles of solar panels, calculating energy gains, and making large-scale estimates, ranging from individual rooftops to entire cities and neighbourhoods.


The structure followed in the program:
